# Operations

Most opperations that are supported in javascript are also suppored in Hackclub Esolang. I can confirm that all of these opperations work, others may but I did not test `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `&&` and `||`. 

Opperations are only able to be used when creating a varible. They can not be used in a `sendMessage()` statment.
