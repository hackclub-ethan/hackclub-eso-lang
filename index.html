    <h2>Docs</h2>
    
    <p>The full docs are located in the <a href="https://github.com/hackclub-ethan/hackclub-eso-lang/tree/main/docs"><code>/docs</code></a> folder. A mini version of the docs are located below</p>

    <h3>sendMessage()</h3>

    <p>This is the print function in the lang. Here is an example:</p>

    <code>sendMessage("Hello, World!")</code>

    <h3>Varibles</h3>

    <p>Varibles can hold all kinds of values such as numbers, booleans, strings, etc. Opperations such as addition are supported as well. Here is an example of doing an oppeation in a varible</p>

    <code>propose num1 = 5 + 5</code>

    <p>That code would set the varible <code>num1</code> to <code>10</code>. <br /> All varibles are global and do not have any local scope. To change the value of a varible, you must use the some syntax to declare it. Here is an example if I wanted to re-define the value of <code>num1</code> to <code>3.14159</code></p>

    <code>propose num1 = 3.14159</code>

    <h3>Functions</h3>

    <p>Functions is a block of code that can be ran through out the program. In this lang functions support aguments and return statments. Here is an example of a function to add 2 numbers together and return the sum.</p>

    <code>ysws add(num1, num2) {<br/>
        propose sum = num1 + num2<br/>
        return sum<br/>
    }</code>

    <h3>Error handling</h3>

    <p>This lang has error handling similer in concept to try...catch statments in other langs. The main diffrence is that in this lang only one statment is supported for the code to run and the "catch code" per statment.</p>

    <p>Here is an example where a function is called with the incorrect number of params</p>
    
    <code>ysws func() {<br/>
    sendMessage("This is a function")<br/>
}<br/>

proposal(func("Hello"), sendMessage("The function call errored"))</code>
