# Plan

Plan for the syntax of the lang.

I need the following features:
- Variables
- Numerical and Boolean Operators
- Functions/methods (with aguments)
- Error handeling (ex: try, catch)

## Varibles

## Operators

This will be the same as Javascript. `+` for plus, `&&` for and, etc

## Functions

Format will be:

```text
ysws nameHERE(args...) {
    CODE
}
```

## Error handleing

It will be a try catch block

```text
propose {
    CODE
} proposalRejected (e) {
    CODE
}
```
